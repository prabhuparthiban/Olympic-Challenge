120 years of Olympic Data - Maven Analytics Challenge

My Submission to Maven Anaytics Challenge on 120 years of Olympics data

**Observations/Findings: 

* Imputed missing values using the Mean values for Age, Height & Weight columns (mean for medalists v non-medalists separately)
* Thanks to the Smart Narrative feature of #PowerBI in summarising the findings/insights.
* Female participation has steadily increased since 1960s after their first representation in 1900
* US, Russia, Germany - consistently successful countries
* Summer games are most popular vs winter
* Maximum medals were won in 2008 Beijing Olympics (also Max. Medalists)
